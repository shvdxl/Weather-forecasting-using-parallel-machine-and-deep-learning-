Accurate rainfall forecasting is a significant matter
 that affects various sector such as agriculture, water resource
 management, and disaster preparedness. using traditional meth
ods to predict the rainfall proof its accuracy. However it faces
 challenges in handling large datasets and achieving real-time
 predictions. In this context, our research focuses on utilizing the
 parallelism in the random forest (RF) algorithm to investigate the
 effectiveness in using this algorithm to enhance computational
 efficiency. In addition to comparing the results of our parallel
 RF model with sequential RF. Furthermore, in this study we
 implement distributed training with logistic regression model
 using deep learning approach. Then we will compare it with the
 sequential implementation of logistic regression deep learning
 model.The motivation for this study is to reduce any socio
economic negative impacts of unpredictable weather patterns that
 could lead to disasters. The dataset we used for implementing
 the model contains about 10 years of daily rainfall prediction
 collected from different Australian weather stations. The result
 shows that the time sequential RF needed to finish its training
 is much larger than the parallel RF. For the sequential RF the
 training time was 364.186 seconds, on the other hand the parallel
 RF needed 72.668 seconds with 8 cores.
